                  variables inside the curly brackets {}. Now, these curly brackets can be of loops, or conditional

              <br>

              <p class="card-text mt-3 ">JavaScript has a runtime model based on an <span
                  class="paragraph-color-style">event loop</span>, which is responsible for executing the code,
                collecting and processing events, and executing queued sub-tasks.
                <br>
                <br>
                <span class="paragraph-color-style">The Event Loop</span> is a mechanism that allows JavaScript to
                perform non-blocking operations. It is the secret behind <span
                  class="paragraph-color-style">JavaScript’s asynchronous programming</span> and gives us an illusion of
                being multithreaded even though it is single-threaded.
                <br>
                <br>
                When an asynchronous task is started, it will start running. Once the task is completed, it will again
                check for any other tasks that need to be performed.
                <br>
                <br>
                So it can be said that <span class="paragraph-color-style"> the Event Loop</span> has one simple job —
                to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take
                the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it.

              <ul>

                <li>A variable that has not been assigned a value will give <span

                <br>
                <li>Function with no return will be<span class="paragraph-color-style"> undefined</span>.</li>
                <br>
                <li> The value will be <span class="paragraph-color-style">undefined</span> if parameter is not passed.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li> If return has nothing on the right side will return <span class="paragraph-color-style">undefined
                    value</span></li>
                <br>
                <li>Property that doesn't exist on an object will give you<span class="paragraph-color-style"> undefined

                <br>
                <li>Accessing array elements outside of the index range will be<span class="paragraph-color-style">
                    undefined</span></li>
                <br>
                <li>Deleting an element inside an array.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Set a value directly to undefined.</li>
                <br>
